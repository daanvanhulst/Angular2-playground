# Angular2 playground #

Project that has been setup to play around with Angular. Project started with just npm as a build tool, but has been switched to use gulp. 

The gulp system has just been setup to work, and needs to be reworked so that it is a bit more sophisticated.

## Prerequisites ##

- npm

## Get started (gulp) ##

If not already installed, run:

> npm install -g gulp typescript

Then install local packages:

> npm install

And to run (todo: combine tasks):

> gulp clean

> gulp build

> gulp webserver

Server will now be running at localhost:3030.

## Using npm (old, but working) ##

Skip the Get started for Gulp. 

Just do a npm install and run npm start
